Program #3

Name: Ryan Cook

COSC 4740

How to compile:
    1. g++ part1.cpp -lpthread -o part1
        ./part1
    
    2. g++ part2.cpp -lpthread -o part2
        ./part2
    
    3. g++ part3.cpp -lpthread -o part3
        ./part3 10 10       //or any combo of numbers
    
    4. g++ part4.cpp -lpthread -o part4
        ./part4

        
I am questioning part 4, either the prints are misleading or every once in a while a job is accepted when a tech gets back
right away instead of letting the tech finish the coffee.

1 2 and 3 look accurate
